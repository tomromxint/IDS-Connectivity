# Getting Started

Open Integration Hub is a framework which you can run on your own infrastructure and in different compositions, depending on your use case. This flexibility can be challenging in the beginning.

To help you getting started, we created two guides for running Open Integration Hub locally and on Google Cloud Platform.
If you first want to understand more about how it actually works, we suggest you start with the Service Collaboration Overview.

After you deployed your own Open Integration Hub instance, check out the User Guide. You will learn how to setup your frist example flow using generic integration components.
